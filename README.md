**Description**

My humble response to SQLI's I Can Code exercise:  [http://icancode.sqli.com/participer.html][1]

**Context**

After at least 8 months of full time programming with PHP/Symfony, I needed to get back to Java and keep my brain JVM compiler alive... and it was raining all this weekend :)

**Aim**

My goal is to to get the maximum of your code review, remarks and why not pull requests.
